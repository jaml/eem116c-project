We have a research tool paper describing the motivation, design, and implementation of X-Mem, as well as three experimental case studies using tools to deliver insights useful to both cloud providers and subscribers. If you use our tool and publish or otherwise publicly report results, we ask that you please cite the following paper as well as provide a link to our tool homepage (https://nanocad-lab.github.io/X-Mem).
