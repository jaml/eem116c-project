         * @param len Length of mem_array in bytes. This must be a multiple of 4 KB and should be at least the per-thread working set size times the number of worker threads.
         * @param iterations Number of iterations of the complete benchmark. Used to average results and provide a measure of consistency and reproducibility.
         * @param num_worker_threads The number of worker threads to use in the benchmark.
         * @param mem_node The logical memory NUMA node used in the benchmark.
         * @param cpu_node The logical CPU NUMA node to use for the benchmark.
         * @param pattern_mode This indicates the general type of access pattern used, e.g. sequential or random.
         * @param rw_mode This indicates the general type of read/write mix used, e.g. pure reads or pure writes.
         * @param chunk_size Size of an individual memory access for load-generating worker threads.
         * @param stride_size For sequential access patterns, this is the address distance between successive accesses, counted in chunks. Negative values indicate a reversed access pattern. A stride of +/-1 is purely sequential.
         * @param dram_power_readers A group of PowerReader objects for measuring DRAM power.
         * @param name The name of the benchmark to use when reporting to console.
