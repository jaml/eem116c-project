; Arguments:
; rcx is address of the first 256-bit word in the array
; rdx is address of the last 256-bit word in the array

; rax holds number of words accessed
; rcx holds the first 256-bit word address
; rdx holds the target total number of words to access
; xmm0 holds result from reading the memory 256-bit wide
